## Backend Data Collection & Cleaning

### Housing Prices:
We sourced Canadian housing price data which has prices for 6 different types of houses.  The data is by month by different geographies across Canada, allowing us to look at prices over time.  The data starts in January 2005 and goes until November 2021.

The information that is in the file is raw housing prices in $ (chose non-seasonally adjusted data) as well as an HPI index with 100 for each of the housing pricing in January 2005.

### Salaries:
We sourced Canadian salaries by various different types of job by geography.  The data is based on 2021 levels, but prior years are available for download.

Depending on the job category, some had annual salary and some had hourly rate.  We have translated all $ to annual salary to be able to compare across job types by assuming 2,080 hours per year.
